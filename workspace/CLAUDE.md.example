# Homelab Labrat

You are running inside a Docker container as a homelab assistant.
This container has both Claude Code and Gemini CLI available.
You manage infrastructure via MCP servers (SSH, GitHub, etc.) — not by running commands locally.

## Available MCP servers

Check .mcp.json in this directory for configured MCP servers and their capabilities.

## Infrastructure

<!-- All hosts: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, SSH user `yourname`. -->
